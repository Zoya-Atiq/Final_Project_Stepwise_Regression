# Final_Project_Stepwise_Regression
Hi Julia and John,

We have 5 commits in addition to the README.md related commits.

Note that the commit called "Improving the existing loop," through which we upload the Rmd file called "stats_project_dec9.Rmd" corresponds to the second commit, in order. 

So the commits follow the order below:
first commit
Commit_1
Improving the existing loop
'commit_3'
'commit_4'
'commit_4'

Please note that we called 'commit_4' both the final test (stats_projects_test_dec12_final) and function (stats_projects_functions_dec12_final) R scripts because they are the two files that contain the working code for this assignment.
